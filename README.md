# Node.js-Professional-README-Generator
_A Nodejs application_

## Description
>This project delivers an applicationt that generates a templatized README file based on the user's input. The intent of the application is to simplify the process for creating a README by using command line functions (via node.js).  The site utilizes Bootstrap components and utilities to create a simple layout with subsections for each part of the document page. When the user clicks on a section, the viewport automatically centers on that part of the page.
    
>When the application runs, the user is prompted to enter information for the following subsections
    1) Project Title
    2) Description
    3) Installation
    4) Usage
    5) Contributions
    6) License
    7) Questions (contact info: github profile, email)
