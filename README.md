# Node.js-Professional-README-Generator

<h3><u>Title: Professional README Generator<u></h3>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
    This project delivers an applicationt that generates a templatized README file based on the user's input. The intent of the application is to simplify the process for creating a README by using command line functions (via node.js).  The site utilizes Bootstrap components and utilities to create a simple layout with subsections for each part of the document page. When the user clicks on a section, the viewport automatically centers on that part of the page.
    
    When the application runs, the user is prompted to enter information for the following subsections:

    1) Project Title
    2) Description
    3) Installation
    4) Usage
    5) Contributions
    6) License
    7) Questions (contact info: github profile, email)
